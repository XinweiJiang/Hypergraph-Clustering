## Contents of the repository
The repository contains Matlab implementation of all methods and experiments, and data files used by the codes. 
The codes grouped based on the problem considered:

#### Subspace clustering
The main codes for the generating the results in the paper are:
* `run_sc_synthetic.m`: Comparison of methods on synthetic data
* `run_sc_motionseg.m`: Comparison of methods on Hopkins 155 motion segmentation benchmark
* `tetris/tetris.m`: main code for the proposed Tetris subspace clustering algorithm

The codes are based on implementations by Dohyung Park for the paper [Greedy Subspace Clustering](arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8864.pdf). 
We have made few modifications in the experimental setup on synthetic data. 
We have also included the codes for the other methods.

#### Hypergraph partitioning
The main codes for the generating the results in the paper are:
* `run_consistency.m`: Comparison of TTM, HOSVD and NH-Cut under planted model
* `run_hypergraph_planted.m`: Comparison of different methods for 3-uniform planted model
* `run_hypergraph_subspace.m`: Comparison of different methods for line clustering problem
* `planted_hypergraph.m`: Contains codes for the proposed algorithms TTM [1,3], HOSVD [4] and NH-Cut [2] 

We have adapted portions of the experimental setup from the implementations by Dohyung Park for the paper [Greedy Subspace Clustering](arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8864.pdf).
We have also included the codes for the other hypergraph partitioning methods, such as hMETIS (Karypis & Kumar, VLSI 2000), HGT (Rota Bulo & Pelillo, TPAMI 2013) and our implementations of SNTF (Shashua, Zass & Hasan, ECCV 2006).
