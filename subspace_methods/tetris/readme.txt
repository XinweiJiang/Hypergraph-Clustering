1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This toolbox contains the Matlab implementation of the 
TeTrIS algorithm (Tensor Trace maximization with Iterative Sampling) proposed in:
 
Debarghya Ghoshdastidar and Ambedkar Dukkipati (2016). Uniform Hypergraph Partitioning: Provable Tensor Methods and Sampling Techniques. arXiv:1602.06516.


The implementation is based on that of the Spectral Curvature Clustering algorithm 
by Guangliang Chen and Gilad Lerman (IJCV 2009).

2. USAGE AND HELP

The main file is tetris.m, which performs clustering of affine subspaces. The simplest way to use them is as follows:

[sampleLabels, averageL2Error] = tetris(X,d,K);

where,

X: N-by-D data matrix 
d: intrinsic dimension
K: number of clusters

sampleLabels: cluster labels of the data points
averageL2Error: averaged L2 error of the detected clusters.

For more detailed description, as well as choices of optional parameters, 
please type in the Matlab command window
